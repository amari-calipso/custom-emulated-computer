# Custom emulated computer
A 16-bit computer architecture i made, emulated in opal.

NOTE: The project is not finished, there will probably be changes in the design and architecture in the future

to run, open or compile `Computer.opal` using the opal compiler, and pass it a file to run as a command line argument.

## Command line arguments
- `--clock`
	- Sets the clock pulse duration of the CPU. Default is 0.
	- **Usage**: --clock [duration]
- `--resolution`
	- Sets the computer screen resolution. Default is 256x256.
	- **Usage**: --resolution [width]x[height]
- `--scale`
	- Sets the computer screen window scale. Default is 1.
	- **Usage**: --scale [scale factor]
- `--hex-dump`
	- Shows an hex dump of the data that is written to RAM after compilation.
	- **Usage** --hex-dump 
- `--time`
	- Shows the time elapsed since the computer started running when the computer stops.
	- **Usage** --time
- `--mixer-words`

# General specs
The computer, designed to have a 16 bits CPU, supports a maximum of 8 GB of RAM (around 4 billion addresses), split in 65536 memory banks, each having a maximum size of 128 KB (65536 addresses). By default, the computer uses 2 MB of RAM split in 16 memory banks. The GPU has a dedicated video memory, that can be of a maximum size of 12 GB (when assuming a 65536x65536 screen resolution). The video memory size depends on the resolution set by the user. By default, it can store 196 KB of data using a 256x256 resolution.

# Registers
The computer contains 5 general purpose registers (X, Y, Z, A, B), 2 of which (A and B) are directly connected to the ALU.
It also contains an alphanumeric display (often used as a data register, referred to as "D"), and a stack pointer (referred to as "S").

# Compiler
## Expressions
- The compiler will accept as expressions:
	-	Integers (signed, unsigned, and in hex);
	-	Characters (indicated with apostrophes, example: 'a');
	-	Labels;
	-	Expressions that only require addition and subtraction between the items mentioned above.
- Expressions can be used with no instruction, and they will be stored in RAM at the address that line of code represents.
- If you leave a field that needs and expression as blank, it will be 0 by default.
## Labels
- Labels are used to identify memory addresses;
- They are created by placing a colon at the beginning of the line, then giving it a name (example: `:loop`);
- Label names can only contain letters and numbers.
## Comments
Code can be commented out using an hash at the beginning of a line.
## Compiler instructions
Some instructions are used to determine computer settings or special actions, and don't get written to RAM. They are easily recognizable because they all start with a dot. Compiler instructions, as opposed to assembly instructions, are case sensitive:
- `.addr`
	- Shifts the next code to start at the address specified.
	- **Usage**: .addr [address]
- `.fill`
	- Fills RAM with a certain number of empty words.
	- **Usage**: .fill [amount]
- `.stack`
	- Locates the stack in RAM and allocates it a certain number of empty words.
	- **Usage**: .stack [size]
- `.string`
	- Fills RAM with a string.
	- **Usage**: .string [string]
- `.interrupt`
	- Locates code assigned to an interrupt subroutine.
	- **Usage**: .interrupt [interrupt number]
- `.waiting`
	-  Locates a segment of code that is ran when the CPU is waiting.
	- This instruction will reserve 7 words of RAM to store a separate program counter for the waiting code section and register states (so that they can get restored when the CPU executes the waiting section again).
	- **Usage**: .waiting
- `.endwaiting`
	- Marks the last line of the waiting segment.
	- The CPU will stop calling the waiting section when waiting once this line has been reached. If you plan on making the waiting section loop, this statement should be omitted.
	- **Usage**: .endwaiting
# GPU
## Full color code
A full color code is a word composed like this:
```
[  modifier  ][   blue   ][   green   ][    red    ]
|-- 1 bit  --||- 5 bits -||- 5 bits  -||- 5 bits  -|
```
The modifier bit is used to switch palettes by offsetting the red, green, and blue values.
## Text color code
A text color code is a word composed like this:
```
[bg blue][bg green][ bg red ][ fg blue ][ fg green ][ fg red ][  char  ]
| 1 bit || 1 bit  || 1 bit  || 2 bits  ||  2 bits  || 2 bits || 7 bits |
```
NOTE:  The character set is not complete yet.
# Sound chip
## Sound code
A sound code is 2 to 4 words of data, composed like this:
```
[ amplitude ][ frequency ]
|- 3 bits  -||- 13 bits -|
[     1st mixer word     ]
|------- 16 bits --------|
[     2nd mixer word     ]
|------- 16 bits --------|
[   sound duration (ms)  ]
|------- 16 bits --------|
```
Mixer codes are used to create a custom waveform by combining multiple waveforms. When the amount of mixer codes is 0, the sound chip will use square waves for every sound. The first mixer code is composed like this:
```
Most significant bit
[    sawtooth width    ][  sawtooth amplitude   ]
|------- 4 bits -------||------- 4 bits --------|
[ square PWM sawtooth width ][ square amplitude ] Least significant bit
|--------- 4 bits ----------||----- 4 bits -----|
```
- The square amplitude controls the relative amplitude of the square wave;
- The square PWM sawtooth width controls the width of a sawtooth wave on which the square wave will be modulated (0 for no modulation);
- The sawtooth amplitude controls the relative amplitude of the sawtooth wave;
- The sawtooth width controls the "width of the rising ramp as a proportion of the total cycle" (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.sawtooth.html) of the sawtooth wave.

The second mixer code is composed like this:

```
[ noise amplitude ][ square duty cycle ][ square amplitude ]
|----- 5 bits ----||------ 6 bits -----||----- 5 bits -----|
```
- The square amplitude controls the relative amplitude of a second square wave;
- The square duty cycle controls the duty cycle of the second square wave;
- The noise amplitude controls the relative amplitude of a white noise sample.
